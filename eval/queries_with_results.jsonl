  "answer": "I have searched online sources for total palm oil production in Malaysia from 2015 to 2025. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) is the main authoritative source for detailed data on palm oil industry performance, including fresh fruit bunches prices, crude palm oil production, and exports. However, exact production figures for the entire period 2015-2025 were not explicitly found in the available search excerpts. For the most accurate and detailed yearly production data, I recommend consulting the Malaysian Palm Oil Board's official reports and releases on their website (https://bepi.mpob.gov.my/).\n\nIf you would like, I can assist in finding more specific annual production statistics or summaries from MPOB or other detailed reports.",

However, for 2020 and 2022, paddy had much lower planted area and production compared to industrial crops. For example, in 2020, paddy was planted on 2,547 hectares producing 7,502 tonnes, whereas industrial crops occupied over 12,000 hectares with production exceeding 110,000 tonnes. This suggests paddy is the crop with relatively lower production in Johor around that period.\n\nSource: Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) - Crop Area and Production by State (2017-2022), https://www.dosm.gov.my",

However, the national data shows that Malaysia produced around 1,686,875.5 tonnes of fruits in 2021 from approximately 199,419.8 hectares planted. Among states with specific data, Sabah produced 106,700 tonnes in 2022 on about 20,922.2 hectares, which is significant but less than the national total.\n\nTo determine the single state with the highest fruit production, more detailed state-specific production data would be needed. From the current data, the national total is the highest combined fruit production across all states, with Melaka producing smaller quantities (around 19,133.9 tonnes in 2021 on 2,861.9 hectares).\n\nSource: Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) - Crop Area and Production by State (2017-2022), https://www.dosm.gov.my",

  "answer": "Farmers in Malaysia manage crop rotation as a sustainable agricultural practice to improve soil health, reduce reliance on chemical inputs, and enhance food security. Crop rotation involves alternating different crop types on the same land across seasons or years. This practice helps maintain soil fertility by alternating legumes (which fix nitrogen) with cereals or vegetables, breaking pest and disease cycles, and optimizing nutrient use. The Malaysian government has been actively promoting the expansion of crop rotation nationwide as part of sustainable farming efforts, such as those seen in initiatives like the Perda Food Valley in Penang. Overall, crop rotation supports environmental sustainability while improving farm productivity and resilience.",

Water when the top inch of soil feels dry.\n\n3. **Soil:** Use well-draining, nutrient-rich potting mix designed for vegetables.\n\n4. **Temperature:** Maintain a stable temperature between 18-24°C (65-75°F), avoiding cold drafts and extreme heat.\n\n5. **Humidity:** Moderate humidity is preferable. Mist plants occasionally if air is dry.\n\n6. **Fertilizing:** Feed with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season.\n\n7. **Air Circulation:** Ensure good airflow around plants to reduce disease risk.\n\n8. **Pest Management:** Regularly check for pests and treat promptly with organic insecticidal soap if needed.\n\n9. **Container Size:** Use containers with drainage holes and appropriate size for the vegetable.\n\n10. **Pruning:** Trim yellow or dead leaves to encourage growth.\n\nFollowing these tips will help maintain healthy indoor vegetable plants and a productive harvest.",
